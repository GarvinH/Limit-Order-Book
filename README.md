# Limit Order Book

This repo tracks the implementation of a limit order book in increasing complexity.

1. Basic bid and ask tracking (FINISHED)
2. Limit and Order tracking (TBD)
3. Optimal performance (TBD)

## Basic bid and ask
Two lists that track quantities of prices. Capable of tracking executions when prices meet limit.

## Limit and Order tracking
Built with inspiration from [this blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20110219163448/http://howtohft.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/how-to-build-a-fast-limit-order-book/).
However, it does not attempt to

## Usage
### C++
This project uses CMake with cpp (GCC) 12.2.1


## Development
### Linux
This project was built using Fedora Linux and KDevelop. No guarantees that other environments will work out of box; may require a small amount of tinkering. For example, it should work with CLion on Windows with a small amount of adjustment.
